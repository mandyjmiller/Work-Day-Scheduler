# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day


## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

I will have met the brief when the following acceptance criteria are met:

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Store events between refreshes of a page
* Additionally, it is responsive, mobile first design as we all depend on our phones for our daily agendas


## Installation

No particular installation requirements. Web page can be viewed using Chrome, Firefox, Safari or most other standard browser, using "Inspect" Console to see the output 
The "Application" tab in Inspect can be used to see the scores which have been saved to LocalStorage.
